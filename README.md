# AVL Tree Functions
This repository contains the function declarations for an AVL tree. An AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree. This means that the heights of the left and right subtrees of any node in the tree differ by at most 1. This property ensures that the tree can be traversed in O(log n) time, where n is the number of nodes in the tree.

## The functions in this repository are:

* `getHeight()`: Returns the height of the given node.
* `util_max()`: Returns the maximum of the two given integers.
* `util_min()`: Returns the minimum of the two given integers.
* `util_abs()`: Returns the absolute value of the given integer.
* `getSize()`: Returns the number of nodes in the given tree.
* `getSum()`: Returns the sum of the keys of all the nodes in the given tree.
* `updateHeight()`: Updates the height of the given node.
* `updateSize()`: Updates the number of nodes in the given tree.
* `updateSum()`: Updates the sum of the keys of all the nodes in the given tree.
* `minToRoot()`: Replaces the root of the given tree with the minimum node in the subtree rooted at the given child.
* `convertToArr()`: Converts the given tree to an array.
* `convertToAVL()`: Converts the given array to an AVL tree.
* `mergeArr()`: Merges the two given arrays into a single AVL tree.
* `rightRotate()`: Performs a right rotation on the given node.
* `leftRotate()`: Performs a left rotation on the given node.
* `balance()`: Balances the given tree.
* `route_R_sum()`: Returns the sum of all the nodes in the right subtree of the given node that are less than or equal to the given key.
* `route_L_sum()`: Returns the sum of all the nodes in the left subtree of the given node that are less than or equal to the given key.
* `avl_search()`: Searches for the given key in the given tree.
* `avl_insert()`: Inserts the given key into the given tree.
* `avl_delete()`: Deletes the given key from the given tree.
* `avl_merge()`: Merges the two given AVL trees.
* `avl_LCA()`: Returns the lowest common ancestor of the two given keys in the given tree.
* `avl_sum()`: Returns the sum of all the nodes in the given tree that have keys between the given lower and upper bounds.
* `new_avl_node()`: Creates a new AVL tree node with the given key.
* `avl_delete_all()`: Deletes all the nodes in the given tree.

### To use these functions, you will need to include the avl.h header file in your code.
#### `your challenge is to code it ;)`
